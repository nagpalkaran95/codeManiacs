This is a personal project taken up by me to learn new technologies and hence implement it side by side. The project implements an <b>Online Judge</b> with added features like tutorials/video tutorials and forums with the basic functionality of code checking for given problems.
<br>Technologies Used : Python, Django, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL

The project is still in initial phase and is shared just for personal use.
